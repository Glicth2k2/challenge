# Deployment Strategy for Real-time PII Defense

## Recommended Deployment Layer: API Gateway Plugin
- Deploy the PII detector and redactor as a plugin or middleware at the API Gateway.
- This allows real-time inspection and redaction of PII on all incoming and outgoing API traffic.
- Advantages:
  - Centralized, scalable, and low latency.
  - Easy integration with existing infrastructure (e.g., NGINX, Kong, Envoy).
  - Cost-effective with minimal changes to downstream services.

## Alternative: DaemonSet Sidecar in Kubernetes
- Deploy as a sidecar container alongside application pods.
- Redacts PII from logs and API traffic before persistence.
- Advantages:
  - Isolates redaction logic from application code.
  - Parallel processing on each pod reduces bottlenecks.

## Optional: Internal Admin Dashboard Integration
- Sanitize PII on internal web applications to prevent accidental exposure.
- Useful for security and compliance teams.

## Summary
The API Gateway Plugin is the preferred approach due to scalability and low latency requirements. Sidecar deployments along with dashboards can be used as complementary layers for robust coverage.
